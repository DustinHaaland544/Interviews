The frustration you're experiencing is, unfortunately, quite common in the job search process. There are several reasons why recruiters and hiring managers may not 
follow up as promised, and understanding these can help manage your expectations and approach.

Volume of Applicants: Recruiters often deal with a high volume of candidates. This can make it challenging for them to follow up with each applicant personally, 
even though they might intend to.

Prioritization: Recruiters prioritize roles and candidates based on urgency and fit. If a role suddenly becomes less of a priority or if another candidate is seen 
as a better fit, follow-ups might fall through the cracks.

Internal Processes: Sometimes, delays are due to internal company processes. Decision-making can be slow, especially if multiple stakeholders are involved or if 
there are changes in hiring needs.

Lack of Feedback: Recruiters may not have feedback from the hiring managers or they might not feel comfortable sharing negative news, leading to a lack of 
communication.

Organizational Changes: Shifts within the recruiting team or the company can impact communication. Changes in team structure, roles, or even company priorities can 
disrupt the follow-up process.

Technical Issues: Sometimes, technical issues or miscommunications can result in missed appointments or lack of follow-up. This might include emails going to spam 
or technical difficulties with scheduling systems.

To navigate these challenges, consider the following strategies:

Follow-Up Proactively: After an interview or a scheduled call, follow up with a polite email if you haven’t heard back within a reasonable time frame. This shows 
your continued interest and keeps you on their radar.

Keep Records: Maintain a detailed log of your applications, including names, dates, and notes on each interaction. This helps in following up appropriately and 
provides a clear picture of your job search efforts.

Network: Sometimes, leveraging your network can provide more reliable leads. Reach out to current or former employees of the company or use platforms like LinkedIn 
to connect with people who can offer insights or referrals.

Be Prepared for Delays: Understanding that delays and non-responses are part of the process can help manage expectations. This isn't a reflection of your worth as 
a candidate but rather a common aspect of job hunting.

Seek Feedback: If you’ve had an interview and haven’t heard back, a polite request for feedback can sometimes prompt a response. Even if you don't get the job, the 
feedback can be valuable for your future applications.

Diversify Your Search: Don’t rely on a single application or interaction. Apply to multiple roles and companies to increase your chances of landing a job.

It's important to remember that the job search process is often lengthy and can be frustrating, but persistence and a strategic approach can eventually lead to 
success. Try not to take the lack of response personally; instead, focus on what you can control in your job search process.
